# Purchase Predictor

**Purchase Predictor** is a machine learning-based web app that predicts whether a user is likely to make a purchase based on two features: **Age** and **Estimated Salary**. The app uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with an RBF kernel to provide predictions.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of a user making a purchase based on **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.
- Simple user interface powered by **Streamlit** for easy interaction.
- Trained using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm with an **RBF kernel**.
- Scalable to more features in the future, with the ability to add more variables as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for training the SVM classifier.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework used for creating the interactive user interface.
- **Pickle**: Used for saving and loading the trained model and scaler.
- **NumPy**: Used for handling numerical arrays.
